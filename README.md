# 🚑 Golden Hour Response – AI-Powered Emergency Healthcare System

### 🧠 Built for **ZYND Aickathon | Healthcare (Golden Hour Track)**

> **Saving lives in the most critical hour through intelligent, coordinated AI agents.**

---

## 🌟 Problem Statement

In medical emergencies, the **Golden Hour**—the first 60 minutes after trauma—is crucial.
Delays in **triage, hospital allocation, routing, and communication** often result in preventable loss of life.

### ⚠️ Current Challenges

* Manual emergency coordination
* No real-time hospital capacity awareness
* Delayed ambulance routing
* Fragmented communication systems

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**Golden Hour Response** is a **multi-agent AI healthcare coordination system** that uses **ZYND Protocol** to enable real-time collaboration between intelligent agents.

Each agent independently reasons about a critical part of the emergency response while the **Orchestrator** ensures seamless coordination.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept: Multi-Agent Intelligence

This system follows **ZYND’s “From Agents to Intelligence Networks”** philosophy.

## 🤖 AI Agents Overview

| Agent                  | Responsibility                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Triage Agent**       | Classifies emergency severity using AI logic   |
| **Hospital Agent**     | Finds nearest hospital with available capacity |
| **Routing Agent**      | Calculates optimal ambulance route             |
| **Notification Agent** | Sends alerts to hospitals, responders & UI     |

Each agent works **independently** yet collaborates through **ZYND Protocol events**.
